"the `contract` section. Instead the contract signatories are implicitly "
"assumed to be the `buyer` defined at release level (known as the "
"`publicAuthority` in the PPP extension) and the `suppliers` listed in the "
"`award` associated with the contract (known as the `preferredBidders` in the"
" PPP extension)."
