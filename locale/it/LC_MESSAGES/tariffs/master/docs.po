"The tariff model builds upon the metrics extension, allowing an array of "
"tariff items, each with an identifier, title, period, value, units and an "
"arbitrary set of dimensions."
msgstr ""

#: README.md:22
msgid ""
"For example, if the toll for a road bridge varies based on (a) the type of "
"vehicle; and (b) the time of day; an implementation of the tariff extension "
"may create new fields for `dimension/vehicleType` and `dimension/timeOfDay`, "
"populating these according to local codelists. In PPP cases, these "
"additional dimensions may mirror those used in the estimated demand and "
"other metrics sections."

"The example below shows a very simply tariff table, without periods or "
"units, but with two dimensions. Tariffs which relate to a particular set of "
"dates could have a `period` block. Those which relate to a particular unit "
"(e.g. tonnes) could have this indicated using a `unit` block."
