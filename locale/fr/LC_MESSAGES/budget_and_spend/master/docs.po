"**A budget** is a forward-looking statements of how an organisation proposes"
" to raise revenues, spend resources, and finance its operations. The "
"National Government budget should cover all the activities of a state. "
"Detailed budgets may also exist at the level of agencies and projects. In "
"public contracting, the funding for a contracting process may come from a "
"particular section of the National budget, or from an organisational budget."
" It may also come wholly or partially from an external funders budget (e.g. "
"an International Development Bank), either directly, or passing through "
"government systems."
msgstr ""

#: README.md:37
msgid ""
"Budget lines are constructed from a set of **classifications** (often "

"classifications), and **measures** (such as the original amount committed to"
" a particular set of classifications, or the modified, or executed, "
"amounts)."

"**Fiscal reports** are records of [an organisations] actual (historical) "
"revenues, **spending** and financing. They may report the fiscal activities "
"of the central government, state governments, or local governments, or of "
"all levels of government in a country (referred to as the general "
"government). Reports may cover a whole government in aggregate as an entity,"
" and/or individual government entities e.g. ministries, departments or "
"agencies. They may be on a cash or accruals basis (full or partial). As "
"payments are made during the execution of a contract, these may be allocated"
" against one or more sections of the budget. In some cases, this may allow "
"the creation of fiscal reporting at the level of individual contracts."

"To avoid duplication of effort by data publishers and consumers, this "

" existing data column names. Whilst FDP makes no direct distinction between "
"'classifications' and 'measures', considering both to be instances of "
"'fiscal concepts', in this extension we do draw a distinction to allow "
"measures to be validated as numerical, whilst classifications can take "

"  | R1 | Uniquely identify each relevant budget line | Yes | BudgetBreakdown"
" is extended with a flexible `classifications` object that can include any "

"used within budget datasets. |  | R2 | Uniquely identify the projects "
"providing funding to a contracting process | Partially | No changes are "
"currently introduced to meet this use case. The core budget object already "

"phases including confirmed budget allocations | Yes | BudgetBreakdown is "
"extended with a flexible `measures` object that can include any number of "
"measure properties, mirroring the terms and column names used within "
"existing budget and spending datasets. |  | R4 | Classify transactions "
"against budget lines | No | Disaggregated financial progress information can"
" be classified against budget lines in the contract implementation "
"`financialProgress/breakdown` section, but the extension does not currently "
"modify the `transactions` block to allow classification at the individual "
"transaction level. | | R5 | Provide information on the transaction process, "
"from invoice to payment | Partial | The `measures` in "
"`financialProgress/breakdown` for each contract can be used to describe "
"different moments of payment processing. However, this only provides a full "
"history of the timing of payment processes when used with a detailed version"
" history of releases. An alternative approach of adding details of "
"`transactions` to represent different moments such as requests for payment "
"and payment approvals has not been included in this extension, but may be "
"developed separately in future. | | R6 | Allow individual amount allocations"
" of budget to contract within OCDS to be checked against overall budget line"
" allocations in a budget dataset | Yes | Through use of a link to the Fiscal"
" Data Package it is possible to compare the contract-level financial "
"information in OCDS with similarly classified information in an FDP. |  | R7"
" | Provide front end interfaces with the information needed to display "
"budget information to users | Yes | When used in conjunction with a Fiscal "
"Data Package, applications can lookup labels and meta-data for each "
