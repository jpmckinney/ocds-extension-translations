"**Requirement Group** A requirement group is a collection of one or more "

"Therefore the CCCEV model can be used to express both **AND** conditions, "
"where a group of requirements must be met to satisfy a criterion, and **OR**"
" conditions, where there are alternative requirements that can satisfy a "
"criterion."
